/*
  As we start to extra common components out of tailwind html we'll put them
  individually here. Anything that needs to change specifically for a page
  should go in stylesheets/context. For instance if we need a special button
  color on the login page, then we should override the .btn component in
  context-specific file such as context/login.scss with the class name from
  that page (e.g .login .btn)

  Base styles that are shared across the entire site should go in application.scss
  (e.g. this will be for things like a, h1, h2, h3, p, etc. Setting custom defaults
  like base fonts and link colors.)
